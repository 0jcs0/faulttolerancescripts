# Analyze the fault tolerance of Virtual Police Stations

A theoretical background is essential to explain why virtual police stations lack preparation. At the dawn of the Internet, users accessed a server via IP addresses. IP addresses are also known as Internet Protocol Addresses.
To simplify human-machine interaction, domains replaced IP addresses. In contemporary times, users type the domain into the browser, like www.example.com. This makes the experience more accessible and user-friendly.
The DNS (Domain Name System) protocol determines the IP address of the web server. It does this when someone types a domain like www.example.com into a browser. The web server \textit{(www)} associates the IP address. In this case, itâ€™s for the domain \textit{example.com}.
